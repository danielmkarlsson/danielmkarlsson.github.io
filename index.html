Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5tt4k30n41tj3x8/No%20value%20without%20utility.scd?dl=1">here</a> to download the No value without utility.scd file that is the piece. It contains code that can be run forever just to listen to it or you can take it apart so you can learn how to make your own Synthdef (which can make sound) and your own Pdef (which can make sequencing). 
At the top of the .scd there is a no previous experience explanation of how to get sound going in SuperCollider and how to get the patch running. 
Throughout the .scd I've tried to make as few assumptions about previous knowledge of SuperCollider as possible although some previous experience with synthesis in general might come in handy but you'll be ok either way.</p>

<p>Another drone of infinite duration. 
Also made with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzepfzu1uy7o0q9/SuperCollider-OSX-3.7.1.zip?dl=1">SuperCollider 3.7</a>

<p>In the Synthdef there is code that can be looked at to:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>.clip value ranges. This is good for frequency parameters.</li>
<li>Frequency Modulation. (Actual FM)</li>
<li>Phase Modulation. (This is often referred to as FM because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7" target="_blank">DX7</a>)</li>
<li>Glissando using XLine. (Xline is exponential)</li>
<li>Amplitude envelope using EnvGen and Env. (Fade in, hold, fade out)</li>
<li>Panning.</li>
<li>Mixing between different parts of the Synthdef.</li>
<li>Resonant Low Pass Filter using RLPF.</li>
<li>tanh. (A kind of distortion)</li>
<li>Resonz. (A kind of ringing filter)</li>
<li>AmpCompA. (Does a kind of compensation that follows your hearing)</li>
<li>Compression using Compander. (Too much dynamics is too much)</li>
<li>LeakDC. (May solve problems with DC offset)</li>
<li>High Pass Filter. (used as a DC problems + rumbly low end fix)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In the Pdef there is code that can be looked at to learn:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Sequencing of various parameters in a Synthdef.</li>
<li>Pseed. (A set permutation of infinite duration)</li>
<li>Pwhite. (Random floats between two values)</li>
<li>Pexprand. (The lower the value the more likely it is to get chosen)</li>
<li>Prand. (All values equally likely to get chosen at any time)</li>
<li>Patterns in patterns. Mix and match Pattern objects together.</li>
<li>Pkey. (Choices made based on another parameters outcome)</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>The title alludes to a conversation I had with a colleague about the purpose of making music. We discussed what can be 
hoped for in terms of a best case scenario outcome from someone having heard it. To loose one's self to the act of listening. 
To become fully that which is attentively experiencing the music. I've also felt a need to separate myself 
from my work. I want to give my work away and  to free my music from myself. To make it free not only in a strictly monetary 
sense but also to make it's inner workings available and approachable. To open it up. I increasingly want to steer clear 
of any mystery surrounding the mechanical aspects of how my music is produced. What remains should be my choices. 
I am at unease by how entrenched in secrecy the means of production can be. To what avail? This .scd is valuable to me. 
It contains solutions to problems I've encountered producing music. It represents a realization of potential. 
Essentially it turns my dreams into reality. I am attempting to make this .scd valuable to you as well. I hope it 
is of use to you, not only for its sonorous capabilities, but also as a means for you to approach SuperCollider for your 
own ends. It would be wrong for me to not share this code with others. Not sharing would be a disservice to others as 
it would place limits on learning. 
On a fundamental level I feel that the only way I deserve to know anything is to share that knowledge, with everyone. 
Briefly put: I want to enable you to do things. To listen to my music is one of them, to explore making music of your own 
with SuperCollider is another.
