<p>A drone of infinite duration. <br>
Made with <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/download/Version-3.7.1/SuperCollider-OSX-3.7.1.zip">SuperCollider 3.7</a> <br> 
Listen to the beginning of it in the player above. <br>
Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2k34u6e2fmw81ci/A%20loss%20of%20self.scd?dl=1">here</a> to download the .scd file that is the piece. It contains code that can be run forever just to listen to it or you can take it apart so you can learn how to make your own Synthdef (which can make sound) and your own Pdef (which can make sequencing). 
At the top of the .scd there is a no previous experience explanation of how to get sound going in SuperCollider and how to get the patch running. 
Throughout the .scd I've tried to make as few assumptions about previous knowledge of SuperCollider as possible although some previous experience with synthesis in general might come in handy but you'll be ok either way.</p>

<p>In the Synthdef there is code that can be looked at to:</p>

<ul>
<li>.clip value ranges. This is good for frequency parameters.</li>
<li>Frequency Modulation. (Actual FM)</li>
<li>Phase Modulation. (This is often referred to as FM because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7">DX7</a>)</li>
<li>Glissando using XLine (Xline is exponential)</li>
<li>Amplitude envelope using EnvGen &amp; Env. (fade in, hold, fade out)</li>
<li>Panning.</li>
<li>Mixing between different parts of the Synthdef.</li>
<li>Resonant Low Pass Filter using RLPF.</li>
<li>tanh (A kind of distortion)</li>
<li>Resonz (A kind of ringing filter)</li>
<li>AmpCompA (Does a kind of compensation that follows your hearing)</li>
<li>Compression using Compander. (Too much dynamics is not good)</li>
<li>LeakDC (May solve problems with DC offset)</li>
<li>High Pass Filter (used as a DC problems + rumbly low end fix)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Pdef there is code that can be looked at to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequencing of various parameters in a Synthdef.</li>
<li>Pseed (A set permutation of infinite duration)</li>
<li>Pwhite (Random floats between two values)</li>
<li>Pexprand (The lower the value the more likely it is to get chosen)</li>
<li>Prand (All values equally likely to get chosen at any time)</li>
<li>Patterns in patterns. Mix and match Pattern objects together.</li>
<li>Pkey (Choices made based on another parameters outcome)</li>
</ul>
