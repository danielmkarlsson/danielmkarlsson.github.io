This is good for frequency parameters.\r\n* Frequency Modulation. (Actual FM)\r\n* Phase Modulation. (This is often referred to as FM because of the [DX7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7))\r\n* Glissando using XLine (Xline is exponential)\r\n* Amplitude envelope using EnvGen & Env. (fade in, hold, fade out)\r\n* Panning.\r\n* Mixing between different parts of the Synthdef.\r\n* Resonant Low Pass Filter using RLPF.\r\n* tanh (A kind of distortion)\r\n* Resonz (A kind of ringing filter)\r\n* AmpCompA (Does a kind of compensation that follows your hearing)\r\n* Compression using Compander. (Too much dynamics is not good)\r\n* LeakDC (May solve problems with DC offset)\r\n* High Pass Filter (used as a DC problems + rumbly low end fix)\r\n\r\nIn the Pdef there is code that can be looked at to learn:\r\n\r\n* Sequencing of various parameters in a Synthdef.\r\n* Pseed (A set permutation of infinite duration)\r\n* Pwhite (Random floats between two values)\r\n* Pexprand (The lower the value the more likely it is to get chosen)\r\n* Prand (All values equally likely to get chosen at any time)\r\n* Patterns in patterns. Mix and match Pattern objects together.\r\n* Pkey (Choices made based on another parameters outcome)",
